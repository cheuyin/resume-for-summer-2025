== Experience

#work(
  title: "Software Engineer Intern",
  location: "Vancouver, BC",
  company: "VoltSafe Inc. | TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, React",
  dates: dates-helper(start-date: "January 2024", end-date: "July 2024"),
)
- Built an internal admin dashboard from scratch in React with AWS Cognito, enforcing TOTP multi-factor authentication and role-based access control across protected routes.
- Built an S3-backed file API for a marina management app so document and image uploads did not go through the app server.
- Cut the marina app JS bundle 22% by pruning unused static assets after a Lighthouse pass.
- Dockerized a Prometheus monitoring service for CPU, RAM, and disk on 7+ EC2 web and database servers; the React client polled a REST API with React Query.

== Projects

#generic-one-by-two(
  left: [*CreateYourStory.ai* | Python, FastAPI, React, SQLite (#link("https://github.com/cheuyin/createyourstory.ai")[GitHub])],
  right: dates-helper(start-date: "June 2026", end-date: "July 2026"),
)
- Built a FastAPI background-job pipeline for LLM and image generation with persisted job status so the React client could poll instead of blocking on one long request.
- Validated model output as a Pydantic story graph (nodes, choices, endings) before saving, so broken generations failed closed instead of writing junk to SQLite.
- Added JWT/Argon2 auth, guest sessions, and ownership checks so saved stories stayed private to their owner.

#generic-one-by-two(
  left: [*UBC Course Explorer* | TypeScript, React, Express.js (#link("https://github.com/cheuyin/ubc-course-explorer")[GitHub])],
  right: dates-helper(start-date: "June 2026", end-date: "July 2026"),
)
- Built a React and Express app over 64,000+ UBC course sections across 189 departments, with grade-trend charts, instructor profiles, and a campus room finder.
- Implemented a JSON query language with nested AND/OR/NOT, wildcards, and GROUP-BY aggregations, plus field-level validation, covered by 100+ integration tests.

#generic-one-by-two(
  left: [*AutoDater* | TypeScript, Obsidian API (#link("https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/autodater")[Plugin])],
  right: dates-helper(start-date: "May 2025", end-date: "July 2026"),
)
- Shipped an Obsidian community plugin that writes Created/Updated dates into note frontmatter (500+ downloads).
- After a Reddit post (\~33k views), added date-format options, folder exclusions, and renameable property labels from user feedback; a 6-second debounce avoids extra writes while typing.

#generic-one-by-two(
  left: [*Local AI Coding Agent* | Python, Gemini API (#link("https://github.com/cheuyin/ai-agent-python")[GitHub])],
  right: dates-helper(start-date: "May 2026", end-date: "June 2026"),
)
- Built a Gemini agent loop that calls sandboxed file tools (read, write, run, delete) for up to 20 rounds until the task finishes.
- Validated every file-tool path against the working directory and rejected any that would escape it, so a bad tool call could not reach the rest of the filesystem.

#generic-one-by-two(
  left: [*Pathfinding Visualizer* | TypeScript, React, HTML5 Canvas (#link("https://cheuyin.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/")[Demo])],
  right: dates-helper(start-date: "August 2024", end-date: "June 2025"),
)
- Built a TypeScript/React visualizer for Dijkstra, A\*, and DFS, plus recursive-backtracking maze generation.
- Rewrote grid rendering from React DOM to HTML5 Canvas with requestAnimationFrame, cutting redundant renders 86% (115k to 16k) and raising frame rate from 7 to 60+ FPS.
